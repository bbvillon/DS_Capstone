# Winning the Space Race with Data Science

## Capstone Project â€“ Coursera IBM Data Science Certificate  
**Author:** Bryan Edward Villon  
**Project Goal:** Predict Falcon 9 first-stage landing outcomes using historical data and machine learning

---

## Overview

This project explores how SpaceX revolutionized space launch economics by reusing Falcon 9 first stages. By predicting landing outcomes, competitors and stakeholders can assess mission risks and launch costs more accurately.

A complete end-to-end data science pipeline was built using:

- API data collection
- Web scraping
- Data wrangling and transformation
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- SQL-based analysis
- Interactive visualizations with Folium and Plotly Dash
- Predictive modeling using classification algorithms

## Dashboard Preview

- Plotly Dash App: Interactive charts for site-level launch success, payload correlation, and filter controls  
- Folium Map: Geographical visualization of launch sites and landing outcomes  

---

## ML Model Highlights

- Classification models tested: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN  
- All models achieved ~83.3% accuracy  
- High precision on predicting successful landings (no false negatives)

---

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates how data science can provide actionable insights in aerospace economics and operations. Falcon 9 landing success can be reliably predicted using public launch data and machine learning techniques.
